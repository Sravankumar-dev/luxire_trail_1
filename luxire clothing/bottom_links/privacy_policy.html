            <p class="pb-3">SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
            <h1 class="pb-3">Your Privacy on Luxire.com</h1>
            <p>This policy covers how Luxire treats personal information that Luxire collects and receives, including
                information related to your past use of Luxire.com products. Personal information is information about
                you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is
                not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Luxire
                does not own or control, or to people that Luxire does not employ or manage.</p>
            <h5>Collecting Information</h5>
            <p>Luxire collects personal information when you register with Luxire, when you use Luxire products, when
                you visit Luxire pages or the pages of certain Luxire partners, and when you enter promotions or
                sweepstakes. Luxire may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from
                business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your name, email
                address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register
                with Luxire and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. Luxire automatically receives and
                records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Luxire cookie
                information, and the page you request. Luxire uses information for the following general purposes: to
                customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services,
                contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.</p>
            <h5>Cookies</h5>
            <p>Luxire may set and access Luxire 'cookies' on your computer. Luxire lets other companies that show
                advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use
                of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one.</p>
            <h5>Your Information</h5>
            <p>You can edit your Luxire account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain
                communications relating to the Luxire service, such as service announcements, administrative messages
                and the Luxire Newsletter, that are considered part of your Luxire account, without offering you the
                opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. You can delete your account by contacting Luxire.</p>
            <h5>Confidentiality and Security</h5>
            <p>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come
                into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
                We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect
                personal information about you.</p>
            <h5>Protecting Your Information</h5>
            <p>Luxire does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated
                companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or
                under the following circumstances:</p>
            <p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Luxire under confidentiality
                agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Luxire communicate with you about
                offers from Luxire and our marketing partners.</p>
            <p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or
                defend against legal claims; We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate,
                prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
                threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Luxire' terms of use, or as otherwise
                required by law.</p>
            <p>We transfer information about you if Luxire is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event,
                Luxire will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different
                privacy policy.</p>
            <h5>Policy Updates</h5>
            <p>Luxire may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal
                information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Luxire account or by
                placing a prominent notice on our site</p>
            <p>When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and selling process, we collect the
                personal information you give us such as your name, address and email address. <br>
                When you browse our store, we also automatically receive your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address
                in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.
                <br>
                Email marketing (if applicable): With your permission, we may send you emails about our store, new
                products and other updates.</p>
            <h5>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h5>
            <p>How do you get my consent? </p>
            <p class="pb-2">When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit
                card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our
                collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.
                If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you
                directly for your expressed consent, or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>
            <p>How do I withdraw my consent?</p>
            <p class="pb-2">If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdrawing your consent for us to
                contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at anytime, by
                contacting us at mail@luxire.com or mailing us at: <br>
                Luxire Custom Shirts <br>
                99 Ovinton Ave, Edison, New Jersey, US, 08817</p>
            <h5>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h5>
            <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms
                of Service.</p>
            <h5>SECTION 4 - SHOPIFY</h5>
            <p>Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to
                sell our products and services to you.
                Your data is stored through Shopify’s data storage, databases and the general Shopify application. They
                store your data on a secure server behind a firewall.</p>
            <p>Payment: </p>
            <p>If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase, then Shopify stores your credit card
                data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase
                transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After
                that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. <br>
                All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security
                Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and
                Discover. <br>
                PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its
                service providers. <br>
                For more insight, you may also want to read Shopify’s Terms of Service here or Privacy Statement here.
            </p>
            <h5>SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h5>
            <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to
                the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. <br>
                However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction
                processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to
                them for your purchase-related transactions. <br>
                For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner
                in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. <br>
                In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located a
                different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that
                involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the
                laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. <br>
                As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway
                located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be
                subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act. <br>
                Once you leave our store’s website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no
                longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our website’s Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>Links </p>
            <p>When you click on links on our store, they may direct you away from our site. We are not responsible for
                the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements.</p>
            <h5>SECTION 6 - SECURITY</h5>
            <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices
                to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed.</p>
            <p>If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket
                layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. Although no method of transmission over the
                Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement
                additional generally accepted industry standards.</p>

            <p>Here is a list of cookies that we use. We’ve listed them here so you that you can choose if you want to

                owners so that we may continue to sell products to you.</p>
